# One Dimensional Vtuber
This is a web application to be a Virtual youtuber composed of only string.
the below link is to demo. Note that, this also serves as my test server, and doesn't always return the same page.
Demo: https://cameratest-433434.herokuapp.com

# Development
Because of some security policy, we have to push the programs to a server(e.g. heroku) every time we want to test them as far as I know.
